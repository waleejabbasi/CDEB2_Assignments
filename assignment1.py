6) Write a program to calculate the electricity bill (accept number of unit from user) according to the following criteria :
     Unit                                                     Price  
uptp 100 units                                             no charge
Next 200 units                                              Rs 5 per unit
After 200 units                                             Rs 10 per unit
(For example if input unit is 350 than total bill amount is Rs.3500
(For example if input unit is 97 than total bill amount is Rs.0
(For example if input unit is 150 than total bill amount is Rs.750

7) Write a program to display the last digit of a number.
add_number = int(input("Add a number"))
lastDigit =add_number  % 10
print("your last digit" , lastDigit)

11) A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000.
Ask user for quantity
Suppose, one unit will cost 100.
Judge and print total cost for user.

'''
'''quantity = int(input("Enter quantity: "))  
cost = quantity * 100  # Since one unit costs 100

if cost > 1000:
    discount = cost * 0.10  # 10% discount
    cost -= discount  

print(f"Total cost: {cost}")
